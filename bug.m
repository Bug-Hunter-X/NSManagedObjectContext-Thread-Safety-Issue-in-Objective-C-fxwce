In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and its interaction with threads.  Specifically, attempting to access or modify a managed object context from a thread other than the one it was created on can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.  This is because the context is not thread-safe.

```objectivec
// Incorrect - Accessing the context from a background thread
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
    [self.managedObjectContext performBlock:^{ //This is Correct
        // Access and modify managed objects here
    }];
});

//Another Example
[self.managedObjectContext performBlockAndWait:^{ //This is correct as well
    // access your context
}];
```
